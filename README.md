# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
First import math in program
### Step 2: 
Assign the given first and second coordinates to the list1 and list2 respectively
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  
 ![DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS](formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Print the distance with two precision
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
distance=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))

```


### OUTPUT:
![DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS](python3.png)

### RESULT:

Thus the distance betwwen the two points has been executed successfully
